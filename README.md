# nqueenvisualizer
This project is a Python-based visualizer for solving the N-Queens problem using the Pygame library. The N-Queens problem is a classical backtracking problem where the goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other (i.e., no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal).![Screenshot 2024-10-06 132724](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22bb1cec-d14f-4dd0-894a-84cc0ee277aa)
